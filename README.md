# Transcultural-Conflict-and-Violence
Master's Project. This project implements a Web search engine for a large collection of images that constitute an important part of the TCV dataset that documents the online and print media propaganda materials of the Islamic State (ISIS). The implementation consists of a backend MongoDB database and a frontend HTML/CSS/AJAX/JavaScript application. The middle layer consists of RESTful Web services written in Python Flask. The large data set is provided in Excel format. Python scripts read the Excel data and populate MongoDB. The frontend provides search by province, dates, and other features of the image dataset. Search results are tabulated and hyperlinked to enable easy download of the images.
